    "-   In the “Single GPU” section: To use `bfloat16` in our experiments with reduced precision, we need a GPU with [NVIDIA CUDA compute capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) 8.0 or higher. For example, some Chameleon nodes have A100 or A30 GPUs, which have compute capability 8.0. If we use a V100, with compute capability 7.0, the `bfloat16` capability is actually emulated in software.\n",
    "-   In the “Multiple GPU” section: To practice distributed training with multiple GPUs, will request a node with 4 GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can browse Chameleon hardware configurations for suitable node types using the [Hardware Browser](https://chameleoncloud.org/hardware/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to find nodes with 4x GPUs: if we expand “Advanced Filters”, check the “4” box under “GPU count”, and then click “View”, we can identify some suitable node types: `gpu_a100_pcie`, `gpu_a100_nvlink`, `gpu_v100`, or `gpu_v100_nvlink` at CHI@UC. (The [NVLink](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/nvlink-bridges/)-type nodes have a high-speed interconnect between GPUs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(We will avoid `p100`-based node types for this experiment, because the P100 has less GPU RAM, and less compute capability.)"
